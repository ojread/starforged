[[Ulan Kuzmin]] rushed to his monitoring station and muted the alarm. A powerful signal had been detected coming from Mobius, the black hole around which [[Weyland Outpost]] orbited.

Across the other side of the [[Bitter Zenith]] sector, a huge crystalline Precursor Vault appeared from out of nowhere in the orbit of [[Sapphire]]. The [[Silver Syndicate]] had tight control over all the commerce in the region with many of the major corporation headquarters located on [[Sapphire]]'s wide array of moons. This was all thrown into chaos by the arrival of the vault and most spacers were scared to fly anywhere near it. Vaults had been discovered before in deep space but never so close to civilisation.
