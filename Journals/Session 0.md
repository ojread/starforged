[[Ulan Kuzmin]] rushed to his monitoring station and muted the alarm. A powerful signal had been detected coming from Mobius, the black hole around which [[Weyland Outpost]] orbited.

Across the other side of the [[Bitter Zenith]] sector, a huge crystalline Precursor Vault appeared from out of nowhere in the orbit of [[Sapphire]]. The [[Silver Syndicate]] had tight control over all the commerce in the region with many of the major corporation headquarters located on [[Sapphire]]'s wide array of moons. This was all thrown into chaos by the arrival of the vault and most spacers were scared to fly anywhere near it. Vaults had been discovered before in deep space and on uninhabited planets but never so close to civilisation.

The [[Stellar Watchers]] quickly organised an expedition into the vault. The team reported some incredible discoveries but all contact was suddenly lost when the vault began to emit strange signals.

That's where I come in. I'm Curtis Nadir, previously an agent for the [[Silver Syndicate]], currently a miner operating out of [[Janus Station]], for the [[Obsidian Hammers]]. Five years ago, a precursor vault was discovered on [[Dryad]] and I was sent in as part of the security team for the expedition. I was the only one to make it out before the entrance was sealed.

We encountered strange energies and creatures in there that killed the rest of the team. I raced back to our ship, Elara Five which was altered somehow by the vault. There were strange symbols scrawled all over the walls and mysterious data in the nav computer that didn't make any sense.
